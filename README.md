This is the HaxColors website as it was serving on http://haxcolors.herokuapp.com until 2014-11-03.

The old site now redirects to http://haxcolors.com, which is the new version integrated along http://haxmaps.com, where all the development will happen :D

This legacy version is still hosted for archiving purposes (?) on https://haxcolors-legacy.herokuapp.com/
